Predictive Analysis Using Machine Learning

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview :

This project demonstrates predictive modeling using machine learning techniques for both classification and regression tasks.
It provides a complete end-to-end workflow:

Data preprocessing

Feature selection

Model training

Hyperparameter tuning

Model evaluation and visualization


The project includes two Jupyter notebooks:

Classification â€” Predicting cancer diagnosis using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

Regression â€” Predicting housing prices using the California Housing dataset.

ðŸ›  Features
Data Splitting â€” Trainâ€“test split for unbiased evaluation.

Preprocessing â€” Scaling numerical features with StandardScaler.

Feature Selection â€” Using SelectKBest with mutual_info_classif (classification) and f_regression (regression).


Models Used:

Logistic Regression (classification baseline)

Linear Regression (regression baseline)

Random Forest (alternative model for both tasks)

Hyperparameter Tuning â€” Using GridSearchCV for model optimization.


Evaluation Metrics:

Classification â†’ Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC AUC, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curves

Regression â†’ MAE, RMSE, RÂ², Feature Importance

Visualizations â€” Feature scores, importance charts, and ROC curves.

ðŸ“Š Datasets Used
Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) â€” from sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer

California Housing â€” from sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing

ðŸ“¦ Requirements
Install dependencies before running the notebooks:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
